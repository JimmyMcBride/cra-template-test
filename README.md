# Welcome to My Custom Template!

## How To Install

### yarn

`yarn create react-app <app-name> --template brownbag`

### npm

`npm init react-app <app-name> --template brownbag`

### npx

`npx create-react-app <app-name> --template brownbag`

### global

> If create-react-app is installed globally on your computer you can use this command:

`create-react -app <app-name> --template brownbag`

Just like regular create-react-app but so much more. This template includes:

- bushido-strap
- node-sass
- serve
- styled-components

There is also a `serve` script that let's your run `serve -s build` and a `build-and-serve` script that runs `npm run build && npm run serve`.

## BUSHIDO_STRAP

What is bushido-strap? Well, friend, it is a personal style library of mine. It has a bunch of handy styled components I've slowly crafted over time. It's already set up in this project. [Check out the documentation here to see everything this modest style library has to offer!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bushido-strap)
